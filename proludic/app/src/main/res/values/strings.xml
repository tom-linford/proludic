    <string name="reg_terms_and_conditions">Please read our terms and conditions.</string>
    <string name="drugs_t_and_c">We recommend you do not use Proludic equipment if you are injured or taking pain-masking drugs, as this may cause further injury.</string>
    <string name="pregnancy_t_and_c">We recommend you do not use Proludic equipment whilst you are pregnant, as our equipment has not been designed with pregnancy in mind.</string>
    <string name="doctor_t_and_c">We recommend consulting a doctor if you have any medical conditions prior to exercising with Proludic equipment.</string>
    <string name="injury_t_and_c">We will not be held responsible for any injuries you may sustain from performing any of the exercises.</string>
    <string name="stretch_t_and_c">We always recommend you stretch before and after exercising to avoid injury.</string>
    <string name="forum_t_and_c">The forum on our app is self-managed by users who will report any misuse. We are not held responsible for comments posted in the forum.</string>

    <string name="hint_faqs">FAQs</string>
    <string name="different_equipment_question">Why is this equipment different to traditional outdoor gym equipment?</string>
    <string name="different_equipment_answer">The piston is bi-directional (on nearly all items of equipment), meaning that users are getting two workouts on one piece of equipment. They have to push to extend, and pull to return the unit to its starting position. The piston can also be adjusted so that you get a real gym feel, where you can exercise with a resistance higher than your own weight – this is inclusive and suitable for all abilities.</string>
    <string name="suitable_for_children_question">Can young children use this equipment?</string>
    <string name="suitable_for_children_answer">No, this equipment is only suitable for children aged 14+. The new EN16630 standard stipulates that children under the height of 1.4m should not be encouraged to undertake repetitive strain when exercising. Proludic Urbanix is tested to, and adheres to these rules. There should also be a minimum distance or barrier between a play area and any outdoor gym equipment.</string>
    <string name="find_out_more_question">How can I find out more about the equipment?</string>
    <string name="find_out_more_answer">Visit our website for full product information, or call our offices on 01159823980 to arrange a site visit with your local Area Sales Manager.</string>
    <string name="how_long_results_question">How long till I see results?</string>
    <string name="how_long_results_answer">For some, 30 days is enough time to see results, such as an increase in energy levels and toning, but for most it can take longer. A commitment to exercise for 30 days is a great first step towards an ongoing fitness campaign and a healthier lifestyle.</string>
